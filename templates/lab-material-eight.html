            <h2>Principles of Database Normalization</h2>
            <p>This material focuses on the topic of database normalization, covering its theoretical and practical
                applications. It introduces functional dependencies as constraints between attributes and explains how
                they are used to define relation schemas. Practical exercises involve creating tables and normalizing
                them according to the discussed normal forms.</p>
            <h2>DB Design Theory and Normalization</h2>
            <p>DB Design</p>
            <ul>
                <li>So far, we have assumed that attributes are grouped to form
                    a relation schema by using the common sense of the database
                    designer, leading to natural and logical grouping of the
                    attributes.</li>
                <li>But it is very important to have a measure of the goodness or
                    the quality of our relation schemas. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some of the most common problems that we usually have in our schemas are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anomalies that cause redundant work during insertion,
                    modification or deletion of a relation.</li>
                <li>Waste of storage space due to NULLs and the difficult to
                    perform selections, aggregations and joins due to NULL values.</li>
                <li>Generation of invalid data during joins, matching attributes
                    that may not represent a proper relationship.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Functional Dependencies</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A constraint between two sets of attributes from the database.</li>
                <li>A functional dependency, denoted by <b>X → Y</b>, means that the value of Y
                    <b>depend on</b>, or is determined by, the value of X.<br>
                    X → Y doesn't infer Y → X
                </li>
                <li>The main use is to describe a relation schema by specifying constrains on its
                    attributes that must hold at all times.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Normalization</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The normalization process apply several tests to a relation
                    schema to certify that it satisfies a certain normal form.
                </li>
                <li>The normal form of a relation refers to the highest normal
                    form condition that it meets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Normalization based on Primary Key</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The defined and commonly used normal forms are:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 NF</li>
                    <li>2 NF</li>
                    <li>3 NF</li>
                    <li>BCNF</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Other normal forms that are impractical to use are: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 NF </li>
                    <li>5 NF</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

                <h3>Normalization: The Journey of the Messy Library</h3>
                <p>Imagine a grand, ancient library filled with countless books. This library is a treasure trove of
                    knowledge, but over the years, it has become disorganized. Books are scattered, some shelves hold
                    mixed genres, and finding a specific book is like finding a needle in a haystack. The librarians,
                    with their love for order, decide to embark on a journey to reorganize the library, making it a
                    place where any book can be found with ease. This journey is akin to the process of normalization in
                    databases.</p>
                <h3>First Normal Form (1NF): Organizing by Genre</h3>
                <p>The first step the librarians take is to ensure that each shelf holds books of a single genre only.
                    No more shelves with both mystery novels and cookbooks mixed together. Every shelf is dedicated to a
                    single genre.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Example:</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Before 1NF:
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Shelf 1: Mystery, Cooking, Sci-Fi
                            </li>
                            <li>Shelf 2: Romance, History</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>
                            After 1NF:
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Shelf 1: Mystery</li>
                            <li>Shelf 2: Cooking</li>
                            <li>Shelf 3: Sci-Fi</li>
                            <li>Shelf 4: Romance</li>
                            <li>Shelf 5: History</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Now, every shelf has books from only one genre, making it easier to find a book of a specific
                        type.</li>
                    <li><b>Synonym:</b> Sorting by genre.</li>
                    <li><b>Rule:</b>Each column in a table must contain atomic, indivisible values.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Second Normal Form (2NF): Grouping by Author</h3>
                <p>Next, the librarians realize that within each genre, books by the same author should be grouped
                    together. This way, readers who enjoy a particular author's style can easily find all their works.
                </p>

                    <li><b>Example:</b></li>

                            </li>
                            <li>Shelf 2: Sci-Fi (Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Various Authors)</li>
                        </ul>

                    </ul>
                    <li>Books by the same author are now together within their genre, making it even easier to locate
                        specific books.</li>
                    <li><b>Synonym:</b> Grouping by author.</li>
                    <li><b>Rule:</b>The table must be in 1NF, and all non-key attributes must be fully functionally

                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Third Normal Form (3NF): Detailing Editions</h3>
                <p>As the librarians continue their work, they notice that some authors have multiple editions of their
                    books. To make it more convenient, they decide to separate books not just by author, but by edition
                    as well.</p>

                <p>Finally, the most powerful enchantment, Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), was the Ultimate Spell of
                    Purity. This spell ensured that every determinant in the table was a candidate key, perfecting the
                    organization.</p>

                    <li><b>Example:</b>Imagine we have a situation where multiple attributes together form the primary

                <p>Through this journey of normalization, the library transforms from a chaotic collection of books into
                    a well-organized sanctuary of knowledge. Each step in normalization—organizing by genre, grouping by
                    author, detailing by edition, and ensuring uniqueness—mirrors the process of structuring a database
                    to make it efficient and easy to navigate. Just as the librarians brought order to their library,
                    normalization brings order to data.</p>
